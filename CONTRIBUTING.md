Types of Contributions
----------------------

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/dssg/triage/issues>.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

-   Your operating system name and version.
-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
    troubleshooting.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Write Documentation

Triage could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Triage docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

The [documentation site](https://dssg.github.io/triage) runs on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and is controlled by the [docs/sources](docs/sources) directory. We recommend building the docs locally to preview any documentation pages. The python dependencies for this are handled by [requirements/dev.txt](requirements/dev.txt):

```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

Once this is done, you can modify any of the pages under the documentation root directory, and change general doc site configuration in [docs/mkdocs.yml](docs/mkdocs.yml). While modifying a documentation page, you can preview your changes by running the mkdocs dev server:
```
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
<https://github.com/dssg/triage/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to
    implement.


### Write Code

Triage always has a backlog of issues. Want to help out? Here's how to set up triage for local development.


1. [Set up your development environment if you haven't already](#triage-development-environment)

2.  Assign yourself the issue on the issues page, to let the team know you're working on it.

3.  Create a branch for local development:

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

4.  Make the necessary changes to tests and code.

    Triage has several code standards that are worth mentioning here. The write-ups are too long to include in the body of this list, so click the links to view them below on this page.

    - [Small Changes](#small-changes)
    - [Testing](#testing)
    - [Code Style](#code-style)
    - [Validation](#validation)
    - [Experiment Versioning](#experiment-versioning)
    - [Documentation](#documentation)

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8
    and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

        $ pip install -r requirement/test.txt
        $ flake8 triage tests
        $ python setup.py test or py.test
        $ tox

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. If you've made multiple commits, squash them into one. Each pull request should be one commit (unless there are multiple logical places to split up the code, for instance a big reformatting commit followed by a smaller commit that actually changes behavior). To make the pull request easier to create, the last commit on the branch should be formatted like the following.

    ```
    One-line summary [Resolves #issueno]

    Optional longer text description

    - optional enumerated change to file #1 and related files
    - optional enumerated change to file #2 and related files
    ```

    The top line will be prepopulated by Github as the title of the pull request. The [Resolves #issueno] will automatically close the referenced issue when the commit is merged into master. The rest of the text will be prepopulated by Github as the content of the pull request. Ideally, you should put any useful text you want to show up in the pull request in the commit message in this way, because the commit message is available to read in the commit history long after the pull request is inconvenient to dig up. Whether or not you feel the commit is best described by a text writeup, enumerated changes, or a combination of both, the One-line summary is very useful no matter what.

    To achieve this format, it's not recommended to use `git commit -m "message"`. Instead use

        $ git commit

    And [write the commit message in your favorite text editor](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/)

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.  If you are working directly with the DSaPP team, *assign somebody*! Pull requests should not linger for a long time. And tell them that you assigned them. If you aren't working with DSaPP, that's okay, the team will see your pull request.


Triage Development Environment
------------------------------

This section describes the initial setup of a Triage development environment that you'll need to run before writing any code.

1.  Fork the triage repo on GitHub.

2.  Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/triage.git

3.  Set up your local environment.

    You can control your development environment any way you'd like (virtualenv, pyenv, _etc._).

    To quickly bootstrap an environment, invoke the executable `develop` script &ndash; found in the triage repo root &ndash; from your system shell:

        $ ./develop

    The script will launch a "wizard," which will suggest set-up steps and optionally execute these, for example:

        (install) begin

        (pyenv) installed ✓

        (python-3.6.2) installed ✓

        (virtualenv) installed ✓

        (activation) installed ✓

        (libs) install?
        1) yes, install {pip install -r requirement/main.txt -r requirement/test.txt -r requirement/dev.txt}
        2) no, ignore
        #? 1

    Alternatively, you might manage your environment via `virtualenvwrapper`:

        $ mkvirtualenv triage
        $ cd triage/
        $ python setup.py develop

    Or simply via the `venv` module:

        $ cd triage/
        $ python -m venv --prompt triage venv
        $ python setup.py develop

    Regardless of your Python environment, we do recommend installing `triage` in development mode, via `python setup.py develop` or `pip install -e .` (The `develop` script handles this for you.)


Small Changes
-------------
Pull Requests take a lot of time to read. Finding defects is not the only reason to have other developers review code, but it is useful to give them a fighting chance to find defects without taking a ton of time to review. Generally, the smaller the pull request, the better. The ideal pull request is the minimal piece of code that adds value. A lot has been written on the subject; one good write-up is [The Anatomy of A Perfect Pull Request](https://medium.com/@hugooodias/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-pull-request-567382bb6067). 


Testing
-------
Triage has an extensive test suite that is run with every commit by travis-ci. Any pull request will be rejected if it breaks the travis-ci build. To help prevent yourself from encountering annoying test failures at pull request time, we strongly recommend utilizing 'Test-Driven Development' (TDD) to introduce tests along with code. To read up on TDD in general, check out:

- [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
- [Test Driven Development: what it is, and what it is not](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2)

In addition to any requirements needed by the main library (which should be installed when you ran `python setup.py develop` to gain access to Triage itself), you can ensure all testing requirements are installed with:

```
pip install -r requirement/test.txt
```

This is mentioned in the main setup section, but you may have to rerun it over time as test requirements change.

Many of the tests require a Postgres server, so you need the Postgres server executable installed on the system you're developing on. You don't need to create any databases, or even have the server running; the tests that need it take care of starting a server, creating databases, and tearing it all down when they're done.

For a general workflow applying TDD to Triage, consider this example:

Let's say I have decided to change the behavior of the LabelGenerator class in [src/triage/component/architect/label_generators.py](src/triage/component/architect/label_generators.py). The unit test, following the standard within `triage`, will be in [src/tests/architect_tests/test_label_generators.py](src/tests/architect_tests/test_label_generators.py).

If you haven't written any tests in Triage yet, don't worry! There are plenty of examples and helpers for you to refer to and use.

- [src/tests/utils.py](https://github.com/dssg/triage/blob/master/src/tests/utils.py) contains lots of setup utilities to enable you to make your tests as concise as possible without boilerplate. See `rig_engine` (set up a temporary database and project storage) and `get_matrix_store` (create an example matrix and metadata in the format the Triage uses internally).
- [src/tests/architect_tests/test_label_generators.py](src/tests/architect_tests/test_label_generators.py) is a pared-down example of testing database-driven code: both the input data and output data are in a database, which is a common pattern in Triage.
- [src/tests/timechop_tests/test_plotting.py](src/tests/timechop_tests/test_plotting.py) shows an example of how to block out code we don't want to test (internals of the plotting library) but make sure that our code that calls the plotting library is sane enough to run.
- [src/tests/timechop_tests/test_timechop.py](src/tests/timechop_tests/test_timechop.py), while long, shows the testing of various known edge cases that are expected to error. There are no database dependencies here, so all input and output is simply passed in or returned to the client code.
- [src/tests/catwalk_tests/test_integration.py](src/tests/catwalk_tests/test_integration.py) is an example of code that tests an entire subsystem: in this case, the model training/testing/evaluation loop. It makes use of multiple smaller components and of test utils to build the expected input from earlier subsystems.


### 1. Run the test first
Before making any code changes, I run this specific test with:

    $ py.test src/tests/architect_tests/test_label_generators.py 

Running it before writing any code helps as a sanity check to make sure my environment is working correctly and the test hasn't been broken.

Obviously you can skip this step if you are adding a completely new, untested class or function.

### 2. Modify the test so it fails

Provided it works, I now want to look at changing the test (or adding a new one, if this is new code entirely) to reflect the new behavior I expect the class to have. Unit tests are supposed to define expectations of the behavior of the code under test, and my changes to the expected behavior should be reflected in the test. In many cases, this will involve modifying the input or output (or both) of an existing unit test. In other cases, if I want to add a new behavior but leave the existing behavior as an option, I would want to add a new test that covers the new behavior option only.

Running this test again should cause it to fail, because the test has the new behavior and the code it's testing has the old behavior. This step is important because I want to be sure that the test cares enough about the code's behavior to notice that it doesn't match up with expectations.

Adding or updating comments to reflect the test's behavior will be helpful to future developers in the same file as you.

### 3. Change the code to make the test pass

Now I enter the original code file and modify it so that the code reflects my updated expecations, and I run the test again to make sure it passes.

### 4. Repeat with all known affected pieces of code

Some changes only affect one class or function, and that's great! However, sometimes I know up-front that I need to change more than one file. For instance, if I add a required argument to the constructor of the LabelGenerator class, it will need to be added to anything that instantiates a LabelGenerator, such as the Experiment.  The Experiment tests should actually fail at this point, so I can fix that code and run the Experiment test to make sure it works.

### 5. Run the whole suite

There may be side effects of code changes that I don't know about at first. The test suite takes a while to run, so I don't want to run it after every code change I make, but it is a good idea to run it as a sanity check when I'm done with my changes and am ready to pull request.


Code Style
----------
Triage follows the PEP8 code style standards. This is validated with flake8 every commit by travis-ci. Any pull request will be rejected if it introduces code that breaks the travis-ci build. To help prevent yourself from encountering annoying style failures at pull request time, you can run flake8 regularly during code development. You can use Triage's flake8 settings by running it through tox, like so:

    $ pip install flake8 tox
    $ tox -e flake8 src/triage/component/architect/label_generators.py

You may also consider installing flake8 integration in your code editor of choice to be informed of style violations even more quickly.


Validation
----------

The larger Triage entrypoints (e.g. Experiment, Audition) are largely driven by serializable configuration, and implement validation routines so users can validate that configuration without running computationally-intensive code. It is important that the Triage development process keeps these validation routines up to date so users can continue to rely on them.

- **Experiment** - If a code changes adds to or changes Experiment configuration values, the [experiment validation](src/triage/experiments/validate.py) class should be updated. A best effort should be made to raise any issues with the experiment definition that can be caught before running the full experiment. This can involve checking values against whitelists, inspecting given database tables, or even running some version of given queries through an EXPLAIN command.
- **Audition** - If a code changes or adds to Audition configuration values, the [validate method of the AuditionRunner class](src/triage/component/audition/__init__.py) should be updated.


Experiment Versioning
---------------------
If the change breaks old experiment definitions, the experiment config version should be updated in both the [example experiment config](example/config/experiment.yaml) and [experiment module base](src/triage/experiments/__init__.py)

Documentation
-------------

- All classes/methods should have docstrings describing their purpose
- If the code adds or changes experiment configuration values, the [example experiment config](example/config/experiment.yaml) should be updated with the new or changed experiment configuration, and instructions for using it.
- If the code adds to or changes the behavior of the Experiment, update:
    - [Experiment Algorithm Page](docs/sources/experiments/algorithm.md)
    - [DirtyDuck Tutorial](https://www.github.com/dssg/dirtyduck)
