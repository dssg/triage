Building data science systems requires answering many design questions, turning them into modeling choices, which in turn run  machine learning models. Questions such as cohort selection, unit of analysis determination, outcome determination, feature (explanantory variables) generation, model/classifier training, evaluation, selection, and list generation are often complicated and hard to choose apriori. In addition, once these choices are made, they have to be combined in different ways throughout the course of a project.

Triage is designed to:

- Guide users (data scientists, analysts, researchers) through these design choices by highlighting critical operational use questions.
- Provide an integrated interface to components that are needed throughout a data science project workflow.

## Installation

To install Triage, you need:

- Python 3.8+
- A PostgreSQL 9.6+ database with your source data (events,
  geographical data, etc) loaded.
  - **NOTE**: If your database is PostgreSQL 11+ you will get some
    speed improvements. We recommend to update to a recent
    version of PostgreSQL.
- Ample space on an available disk, (or for example in Amazon Web
  Services's S3), to store the needed matrices and models for your
  experiments

We recommend starting with a new python virtual environment and pip installing triage there.
```bash
$ virtualenv triage-env
$ . triage-env/bin/activate
(triage-env) $ pip install triage
```

## Data
Triage needs data in a postgres database and a configuration file that has credentials for the database. The Triage CLI defaults database connection information to a file stored in 'database.yaml' (example in [example/database.yaml](https://github.com/dssg/triage/blob/master/example/database.yaml)).

If you don't want to install Postgres yourself, try `triage db up` to create a vanilla Postgres 12 database using docker. For more details on this command, check out [Triage Database Provisioner](db.md)

## Configure Triage for your project

Triage is configured with a config.yaml file that has parameters defined for each component. You can see some [sample configuration with explanations](https://github.com/dssg/triage/blob/master/example/config/experiment.yaml) to see what configuration looks like.

## Using Triage

1. Via CLI:
```bash

triage experiment example/config/experiment.yaml
```
2. Import as a python package:
```python
from triage.experiments import SingleThreadedExperiment

experiment = SingleThreadedExperiment(
    config=experiment_config, # a dictionary
    db_engine=create_engine(...), # http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html
    project_path='/path/to/directory/to/save/data' # could be an S3 path too: 's3://mybucket/myprefix/'
)
experiment.run()
```

There are a plethora of options available for experiment running, affecting things like parallelization, storage, and more. These options are detailed in the [Running an Experiment](https://dssg.github.io/triage/experiments/running/) page.

## Development

Triag was initially developed at [University of Chicago's Center For Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu) and is now being maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.

To build this package (without installation), its dependencies may
alternatively be installed from the terminal using `pip`:

    pip install -r requirement/main.txt

### Testing

To add test (and development) dependencies, use **test.txt**:

    pip install -r requirement/test.txt [-r requirement/dev.txt]

Then, to run tests:

    pytest

### Development Environment

To quickly bootstrap a development environment, having cloned the
repository, invoke the executable `develop` script from your system
shell:

    ./develop

A "wizard" will suggest set-up steps and optionally execute these, for
example:

    (install) begin

    (pyenv) installed

    (python-3.9.10) installed

    (virtualenv) installed

    (activation) installed

    (libs) install?
    1) yes, install {pip install -r requirement/main.txt -r requirement/test.txt -r requirement/dev.txt}
    2) no, ignore
    #? 1
