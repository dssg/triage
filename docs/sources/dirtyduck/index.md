This tutorial will show you how to use `Triage`, a data science
modeling tool developed at the [Center for Data Science and Public
Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu) (DSaPP) at the University of
Chicago.

`Triage` helps build models for two [common applied
problems](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/data-science-for-social-good-conference-2017/training-workshop-data-science-for-social-good-problem-templates/):
(a) Early warning systems (**EWS** or **EIS**), (b) *resource
prioritization* (a.k.a "an inspections problem") . These problems are
difficult to model because their conceptualization and and
implementation are prone to error, given their multi-dimensional,
multi-entity, time-series structure.

**NOTE** This tutorial is in sync with the latest version of
`triage`. At this moment
[v4.0.0](https://github.com/dssg/triage/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
