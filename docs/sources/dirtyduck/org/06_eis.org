* An Early Intervention System

** Problem description

=triage= is designed to also build early warning systems (also called early intervention, EIS).
While there are  several differences between modeling early warnings and inspection
 prioritization, perhaps the biggest is that  the /entity/ is active
(i.e. it is doing stuff for which
 an outcome will happen) in EIS but passive (i.e. inspected)
 in *inspection prioritization*. Among other things, this difference
affects the way the /outcome/ is built.

Here's the question we want to answer:

#+begin_quote
Will my restaurant be inspected in the
/next X period of time?/
#+end_quote

Where $X$ could be 3 days, 2 months, 1 year,
etc.

  Knowing the answer to this question enables you (as the restaurant
  owner or manager) to prepare for the inspection.


** What are the labels? What are the outcomes?

The trick to note is that on any given day there are two possible outcomes:
/the facility was inspected/ and /the facility wasn't inspected/.
Our /outcomes/ table will be larger than in the inspection prioritization example
because we need an /outcome/ for every /active/ facility on every date.
The following image tries to exemplify this reasoning:


#+NAME: fig:outcomes-inspections
#+CAPTION: The image shows three facilities, and next to each, a temporal line with 6 days (0-5). Each dot represents the event (whether an inspection happened). Yellow means the inspection happened (=TRUE= outcome) and blue means it didn't (=FALSE= outcome). Each facility in the image had two inspections, six in total.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600 :height 400
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 400 :height 300
[[./images/outcomes-eis.png]]

Fortunately, =triage= will help us to create this table. The /cohort/
table is the same as the /cohort/ table in the inspection case.


First the usual stuff. Note that we are changing =model_comment= and
=label_definition= (remember that this is used for generating the
/hash/ that differentiates models and model groups).

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
config_version: 'v6'

model_comment: 'eis: 01'

user_metadata:
  label_definition: 'inspected'
  experiment_type: 'eis'
  description: |
    EIS 01
  purpose: 'model creation'
  org: 'DSaPP'
  team: 'Tutorial'
  author: 'Your name here'
  etl_date: '2019-02-21'

model_group_keys:
  - 'class_path'
  - 'parameters'
  - 'feature_names'
  - 'feature_groups'
  - 'cohort_name'
  - 'state'
  - 'label_name'
  - 'label_timespan'
  - 'training_as_of_date_frequency'
  - 'max_training_history'
  - 'label_definition'
  - 'experiment_type'
  - 'org'
  - 'team'
  - 'author'
  - 'purpose'
  - 'etl_date'

#+END_SRC

For the labels the query is pretty simple, if the facility showed in
the data, it will get a /positive/ outcome, if not they will get a /negative/ outcome

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
label_config:
  query: |
    select
    entity_id,
    True::integer as outcome
    from semantic.events
    where '{as_of_date}'::timestamp <= date
    and date < '{as_of_date}'::timestamp + interval '{label_timespan}'
    group by entity_id
  include_missing_labels_in_train_as: False
  name: 'inspected'
#+END_SRC

Note the two introduced changes in this block, first, the /outcome/ is
=True= , because all our observations represent /inspected/ facilities
(see discussion above and in particular previous image), second, we
added the line =include_missing_labels_in_train_as: False=. This line
tells =triage= to incorporate all the missing facilities in the
/training/ matrices with =False= as the /label/.

As stated we will use the same configuration block for /cohorts/ that we
used in inspections:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
cohort_config:
  query: |
    with buckets as (
    select *, ntile(5) over (order by number_of_inspections asc) as bucket
    from (
    select entity_id, count(*) as number_of_inspections
    from semantic.events
    group by entity_id
    ) as t
    )
    select e.entity_id
    from semantic.entities as e
    inner join
    buckets as b
    using (entity_id)
    where
    daterange(start_time, end_time, '[]') @> '{as_of_date}'::date
    and bucket in (5)
  name: 'active_facilities'
#+END_SRC


** Modeling Using Machine Learning

We need to specify the temporal configuration too

**** Temporal configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
temporal_config:
    feature_start_time: '2010-01-04'
    feature_end_time: '2019-01-01'
    label_start_time: '2015-02-01'
    label_end_time: '2019-01-01'

    model_update_frequency: '1y'
    training_label_timespans: ['1month']
    training_as_of_date_frequencies: '1month'

    test_durations: '1y'
    test_label_timespans: ['1month']
    test_as_of_date_frequencies: '1month'

    max_training_histories: '5y'
#+END_SRC


As before, you can generate the image of the temporal blocks:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/triage :results silent
# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment experiments/eis_01.yaml --show-timechop
#+END_SRC


#+CAPTION: Temporal blocks for the Early Warning System. We want to predict the most likely facilities to be inspected in the following month.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 400 :height 300
[[file:triage/images/eis_01.png]]

**** Features

Regarding the features, we will use the same ones that were used in [[file:inspections.org][inspections prioritization]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
feature_aggregations:
  -
    prefix: 'inspections'
    from_obj: 'semantic.events'
    knowledge_date_column: 'date'

    aggregates_imputation:
      count:
        type: 'zero_noflag'

    aggregates:
      -
        quantity:
          total: "*"
        metrics:
          - 'count'

    intervals: ['1month', '3month', '6month', '1y', 'all']

    groups:
      - 'entity_id'

  -
    prefix: 'risks'
    from_obj: 'semantic.events'
    knowledge_date_column: 'date'

    categoricals_imputation:
      sum:
        type: 'zero'
      avg:
        type: 'zero'

    categoricals:
      -
        column: 'risk'
        choices: ['low', 'medium', 'high']
        metrics:
          - 'sum'
          - 'avg'

    intervals: ['1month', '3month', '6month', '1y', 'all']

    groups:
      - 'entity_id'
      - 'zip_code'

  -
    prefix: 'results'
    from_obj: 'semantic.events'
    knowledge_date_column: 'date'

    categoricals_imputation:
      all:
        type: 'zero'

    categoricals:
      -
        column: 'result'
        choice_query: 'select distinct result from semantic.events'
        metrics:
          - 'sum'
          - 'avg'

    intervals: ['1month', '3month', '6month', '1y', 'all']

    groups:
      - 'entity_id'

  -
    prefix: 'inspection_types'
    from_obj: 'semantic.events'
    knowledge_date_column: 'date'

    categoricals_imputation:
      sum:
        type: 'zero_noflag'

    categoricals:
      -
        column: 'type'
        choice_query: 'select distinct type from semantic.events where type is not null'
        metrics:
          - 'sum'

    intervals: ['1month', '3month', '6month', '1y', 'all']

    groups:
      - 'entity_id'
      - 'zip_code'


#+END_SRC

We declare that we want to use all possible feature-group combinations for training:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
feature_group_definition:
   prefix:
     - 'inspections'
     - 'results'
     - 'risks'
     - 'inspection_types'

feature_group_strategies: ['all', 'leave-one-out', 'leave-one-in']
#+END_SRC

i.e. =all= will train models with all the features groups,
=leave-one-in= will use only one of the feature groups for traning, and
lastly, =leave-one-out= will train the model with all the features
except one.

**** Algorithm and hyperparameters

We will collapse the baseline (=DummyClassifier=) and the exploratory configuration together:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
grid_config:
    'sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier':
        max_depth: [2,null]
    'sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier':
        max_features: ['sqrt']
        criterion: ['gini']
        n_estimators: [500]
        min_samples_leaf: [1]
        min_samples_split: [50]
    'sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier':
        strategy: [most_frequent]
#+END_SRC

=triage= will create *36* /model groups/: *4* algorithms and
hyperparameters (2 =DecisionTreeClassifier=, 1
=RandomForestClassifier=, 1 =DummyClassifier=) \times *9* features sets (1
=all=, 4 =leave-one-out=, =4 leave-one-in=). The total number of /models/
is three times that (we have 3 time blocks, so *108* models).

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/experiments/eis_01.yaml
scoring:
    testing_metric_groups:
        -
          metrics: [precision@, recall@]
          thresholds:
            percentiles: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]
            top_n: [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]


    training_metric_groups:
      -
        metrics: [accuracy]
      -
        metrics: [precision@, recall@]
        thresholds:
          percentiles: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]
          top_n: [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]

#+END_SRC

As a last step, we validate that the configuration file is correct:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent

# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment experiments/eis_01.yaml  --validate-only
#+END_SRC


And then just run it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results silent
# Remember to run this in bastion  NOT in your laptop shell!
triage experiment --matrix-format hdf experiments/eis_01.yaml --profile
#+END_SRC

This will take a *lot* amount of time (on my computer took 3h 42m),
so, grab your coffee, chat with
your coworkers, check your email, or read the [[https://dssg.uchicago.edu/blog][DSSG blog]].
It's taking that long for several reasons:

1. There are a lot of models, parameters, etc.
2. We are running in serial mode (i.e. not in parallel).
3. The database is running on your laptop.

You can solve 2 and 3. For the second point you could use the =docker=
container that has the multicore option enabled. For 3, I recommed you
to use a PostgreSQL database in the cloud, such as Amazon's
*PostgreSQL RDS* (we will explore this later in running triage in AWS Batch).

After the experiment finishes, we can create the following table:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
with features_groups as (
select
    model_group_id,
    split_part(unnest(feature_list), '_', 1) as feature_groups
from
    model_metadata.model_groups
),

features_arrays as (
select
    model_group_id,
    array_agg(distinct feature_groups) as feature_groups
from
    features_groups
group by
    model_group_id
)

select
    model_group_id,
    model_type,
    hyperparameters,
    feature_groups,
    array_agg(model_id order by train_end_time asc) as models,
    array_agg(train_end_time::date order by train_end_time asc) as times,
    array_agg(to_char(value, '0.999') order by train_end_time asc) as "precision@10%"
from
    model_metadata.models
    join
    features_arrays using(model_group_id)
    join
    test_results.evaluations using(model_id)
where
    model_comment ~ 'eis'
    and
    metric || parameter = 'precision@10_pct'
group by
    model_group_id,
    model_type,
    hyperparameters,
    feature_groups
order by
    model_group_id;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Audition: So many models, how can I choose the best one?

Let’s select the best model groups, using Audition. We need to make
small changes to the [[file:~/projects/dsapp/dirtyduck/triage/eis_audition_config.yaml][configuration file]] compared to the inspection’s one:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/eis_audition_config.yaml
# CHOOSE MODEL GROUPS
model_groups:
    query: |
        select distinct(model_group_id)
        from model_metadata.model_groups
        where model_config ->> 'experiment_type' ~ 'eis'
# CHOOSE TIMESTAMPS/TRAIN END TIMES
time_stamps:
    query: |
        select distinct train_end_time
        from model_metadata.models
        where model_group_id in ({})
        and extract(day from train_end_time) in (1)
        and train_end_time >= '2015-01-01'
# FILTER
filter:
    metric: 'precision@' # metric of interest
    parameter: '10_pct' # parameter of interest
    max_from_best: 1.0 # The maximum value that the given metric can be worse than the best model for a given train end time.
    threshold_value: 0.0 # The worst absolute value that the given metric should be.
    distance_table: 'eis_distance_table' # name of the distance table
    models_table: 'models' # name of the models table

# RULES
rules:
    -
        shared_parameters:
            -
                metric: 'precision@'
                parameter: '10_pct'

        selection_rules:
            -
                name: 'best_current_value' # Pick the model group with the best current metric value
                n: 3
            -
                name: 'best_average_value' # Pick the model with the highest average metric value
                n: 3
            -
                name: 'lowest_metric_variance' # Pick the model with the lowest metric variance
                n: 3
            -
                name: 'most_frequent_best_dist' # Pick the model that is most frequently within `dist_from_best_case`
                dist_from_best_case: [0.05]
                n: 3

#+END_SRC


And then we run the simulation of the rules againts the experiment as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/triage :exports code :results none
triage --tb audition -c eis_audition_config.yaml --directory audition/eis
#+END_SRC

=Audition= will create several plots that will help you to sort out
which is the /best/ model group to use (like in a production setting or
just to generate your list).

*** Filtering model groups
:PROPERTIES:
:ORDERED:  t
:END:

=Audition= will generate two plots that are meant to be used together:
/model performance over time/ and /distance from best/.

#+CAPTION: Model group performance over time. In this case the metric show is =precision@10%=. The black dashed line represents the (theoretical) system's performance if we select the best performant model in a every evaluation date. The colored lines represents different model groups. All the model groups that share an algorithm will be colored the same.
#+LABEL: fig:performance-over-time-2
[[file:audition/eis/metric_over_time_precision@10_pct.png]]


#+CAPTION: Proportion of *all* the /models/ in a /model group/ that are separated from the best model. The distance is measured in percentual points, i.e. How much less precision at 10 percent of the population compared to the best model in that date.
#+LABEL: fig:distance-from-best-2
[[file:audition/eis/distance_from_best_precision@10_pct.png]]

*** Selecting the best rule or strategy for choosing model groups

In this phase of the audition, you will see what will happen in the
next time if you choose your model group with an specific strategy or
rule.

You then, can calculate the /regret/. /Regret/ is defined as the
difference between the performance of the best model evaluated on the
"next time" and the performance of the model selected by a particular rule.

#+CAPTION: Given a strategy for selecting model groups (in the plot 4 are shown), What will be the performace of the model group chosen by that strategy in the next evaluation date?
#+LABEL: fig:performance-next-time-2
[[file:audition/eis/precision@10_pct_next_time.png]]


#+CAPTION: Given a strategy for selecting model groups (in the plot 4 are shown). What will be the distance (/regret/) to the best theoretical model in the following evaluation date? This plot is similar to the [@fig:distance-from-best-2]
#+LABEL: fig:regret-from-best-given-a-rule-2
[[file:audition/eis/regret_distance_from_best_rules_precision@10_pct.png]]



#+CAPTION: Expected regret for the strategies. The less the better.
#+LABEL: fig:regret-over-time-2
[[file:audition/eis/regret_over_time_precision@10_pct.png]]

It seems that the /worst/ strategy (the one with the bigger “regret”) for selecting
a /model_group/ is =lowest_metric_variance_precision=. The other three
seem almost indistinguishable. We will dig in using Postmodeling. And afterwards
instead of using the feature importance to characterize the
facilities, we will explore how the model is splitting the facilities using
/crosstabs/.

As before, the best *3* /model groups/ per strategy will be stored in the
file =[[file:audition/eis/results_model_group_ids.json][results_model_group_ids.json]]=:

#+INCLUDE: ../triage/audition/eis/results_model_group_ids.json src json


** Postmodeling: Inspecting the best models closely

Given that almost all the strategies perform well, we will change the
parameter =model_group_id= in the [[file:~/projects/dsapp/dirtyduck/triage/eis_postmodeling_config.yaml][postmodeling's configuration file]] and
we will use the complete set of model groups selected by audition:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle ../triage/eis_postmodeling_config.yaml

      select g.model_group_id,
             m.model_id,
             extract('year' from m.evaluation_end_time) as as_of_date_year,

Every model selected by audition has a very similar performance across
time, and they are ~2.5 times above the baseline in
precision@10%. We could also check the recall of the model groups.

There are a high jaccard similarity between some model groups across
time. This could be an indicator that they are so similar that you can
choose any and it won’t matter.

*** Going deeper with a model

We will choose the model group *64* as the winner.


#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select
    mg.model_group_id,
    mg.model_type,
    mg.hyperparameters,
    array_agg(model_id order by train_end_time) as models
from
    model_metadata.model_groups as mg
    inner join
    model_metadata.models
    using (model_group_id)
where model_group_id = 64
group by 1,2,3
#+END_SRC

:end:

But before going to production and start making predictions in unseen
data, let’s see what the particular models are doing. /Postmodeling/
created a =ModelEvaluator= (similar to the =ModelGroupEvaluator=) to do
this exploration:

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session  ./docker-kernel-connection.json :results none
models_64 = { f'{model}': ModelEvaluator(64, model, engine) for model in [190,208,226] }
#+END_SRC

In this tutorial, we will just show some parts of the analysis in the
most recent model, but feel free of exploring the behavior of all the
models in this model group, and check if you can detect any pattern.

**** Feature importances

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session  ./docker-kernel-connection.json :results none :exports code :file ./images/eis_model_group_64_feature_importances.png

** Crosstabs: How are the entities classified?

Model interpretation is a huge topic nowadays, the most obvious path
is using the /features importance/ from the model. This could be useful,
but we could do a lot better.

=Triage= uses =crosstabs= as a different approach that complements the list of
/features importance/. =crosstabs= will run statistical tests to compare
the predicted positive and the predicted false facilities in /each/
feature.

This table represents the ratio between the predicted positives at the
top 5% and predicted negatives (the rest). For example, you can see
that in PP are eleven times more inspected if they have a failed
inspection in the last month, 3.5 times more if they have a failed
inspection in the previous 3 months, etc.
