# Who is this tutorial for?

We created this tutorial with two roles in mind:


- A data scientist/ML practitioner who wants to focus
in the problem at his/her hands, not in the nitty-gritty detail about
how to configure and setup a Machine learning pipeline, Model
governance, Model selection, etc.

- A policy maker with a little of technical background that wants to
  learn how to pose his/her policy problem as a Machine Learning
  problem.
