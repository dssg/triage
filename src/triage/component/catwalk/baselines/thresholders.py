    test matrix to classify entities. By default, it will classify entities as 1
    if they satisfy any of the rules. When 'or' is set as the logical_operator
    attribute, it will classify entities as 1 if they pass *all* of the rules.

    Rules are passed as either strings in the format 'x1 > 5' or dictionaries in
    the format {feature_name: 'x1', operator: '>', threshold: 5}. The
    feature_name, operator, and threshold keys are required. Eventually, this
    class may be abstracted into a BaseThreshold class and more complicated
    thresholders could be built around new keys in the dictionaries (e.g., by
    specifying scores that could be applied (and possibly summed) to entities
    satisfying rules) or by an alternative dictionary format that specifies
    more complicated structures for applying rules (for example:
        {
