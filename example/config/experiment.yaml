# COHORT CONFIG
# Cohorts are configured by passing a query with placeholders for the 'as_of_date'.

#
# You may enter a 'name' for your configuration.
# This will be included in the metadata for each matrix and used to group models
# If you don't pass one, the string 'default' will be used.
#
# This block is completely optional. If you don't specify it
# it will default to all the entities in your event's tables  (from_obj in feature_aggregations).

# LABEL GENERATION
# Labels are configured by passing a query with placeholders for the 'as_of_date' and 'label_timespan'.
#
# The query must return two columns: entity_id and outcome, based on a given as_of_date and label_timespan.
# The as_of_date and label_timespan must be represented by placeholders marked by curly brackets. The example below
# reproduces the inspection outcome boolean-or logic:
#
# In addition, you can configure what label is given to entities that are in the matrix
#   (see 'cohort_config' section) but that do not show up in this label query.
# By default, these will show up as missing/null.
# However, passing the key 'include_missing_labels_in_train_as' allows you to pick True or False.
#
# In addition to these configuration options, you can pass a name to apply to the label configuration
# that will be present in matrix metadata for each matrix created by this experiment,
# under the 'label_name' key. The default label_name is 'outcome'.

# FEATURE GENERATION
# The aggregate features to generate for each train/test split
#
# Implemented by wrapping collate: https://github.com/dssg/collate
# Most terminology here is taken directly from collate
#
# Each entry describes a collate.SpacetimeAggregation object, and the
# arguments needed to create it. Generally, each of these entries controls
# the features from one source table, though in the case of multiple groups
# may result in multiple output tables
#
# Rules specifying how to handle imputation of null values must be explicitly
# defined in your config file. These can be specified in two places: either
# within each feature or overall for each type of feature (aggregates_imputation,
# categoricals_imputation, array_categoricals_imputation). In either case, a rule must be given for
# each aggregation function (e.g., sum, max, avg, etc) used, or a catch-all
# can be specified with `all`. Aggregation function-specific rules will take
# precedence over the `all` rule and feature-specific rules will take
# precedence over the higher-level rules. Several examples are provided below.
#
# Available Imputation Rules:
#   * mean: The average value of the feature (for SpacetimeAggregation the
#           mean is taken within-date).
#   * constant: Fill with a constant value from a required `value` parameter.
#   * zero: Fill with zero.
#   * null_category: Only available for categorical features. Just flag null
#                    values with the null category column.
#   * binary_mode: Only available for aggregate column types. Takes the modal
#                  value for a binary feature.
#   * error: Raise an exception if any null values are encountered for this
#            feature.

# - 'prefix' allows you to specify a list of feature name prefixes
#
# This block is optional. If you don't specify it, it will be defaulted
# to all the 'prefix' in the 'features_aggregation' block.

# USER METADATA
# These are arbitrary keys/values that you can have Triage apply to the
# metadata for every matrix in the experiment. Any keys you include here can
# be used in the 'model_group_keys' below. For example, if you run the entity
# matching algorithm before running the experiment, one can include a `matchdatetime`
# in the `user_metadata` that signifies which set of `entity_id`s was used
# to create a given model/model group. That way, we don't accidentally match
# old predictions with new staged data without looking up the new `entity_id`s first.
user_metadata:
    'matchdatetime': '2019-01-01'

# MODEL GROUPING (optional)
# Model groups are a way of partitioning trained models in a way that makes for easier analysis.
#
# model_group_keys defines a list of training matrix metadata and classifier keys that
# should be considered when creating a model group.
#
# There is an extensive default configuration, which is aimed at producing groups whose
# constituent models are equivalent to each other in all ways except for when they were trained.
# This makes the analysis of model stability easier.
#
# To accomplish this, the following default keys are used:
# 'class_path', 'parameters'
# 'feature_names', 'feature_groups', 'cohort_name', 'state'
# 'label_name', 'label_timespan', 'as_of_date_frequency', 'max_training_history'
#
# If you want to override this list, you can supply a 'model_group_keys' value.
# All of the defaults are available, along with some other temporal information
# that could be useful for more specialized analyses:
#
# 'first_as_of_time', 'last_as_of_time', 'matrix_info_end_time', 'as_of_times', 'feature_start_time'
#
# You can also use any pieces of user_metadata that you included in this experiment definition,
# as they will be present in the matrix metadata.
#
# model_group_keys: ['feature_groups', 'label_definition']




# BIAS AUDIT (optional, please comment the bias_audit_config section if not interested in knowing the biases and equity of the models)
# Every evaluation will include a bias audit (using the Aequitas toolkit).
# To run the bias audit it is necessary to define the protected groups by defining attributes (e.g. race) for every entity
# from_obj parameter: it can be a table name or a query (such as with features generators)
# The from_obj is expected to have the protected attributes in a single table with a entity_id and knowledge date column
# Triage will use the most recent entry of the source table with date < than current as_of_date as the value for those attributes in a given as of date
#
# thresholds:
# Running the bias audit might be slow, so the user should specify which thresholds should be used for the bias audit.
# Percentiles *should be between 0 and 100*, much like Triage model scoring config.
# People familiar with Aequitas may note that this differs from its expected values - Triage will do the conversion for Aequitas.
#
# ref groups:
# Please have a look to Aequitas documentation for further information about the ref_groups_method
# https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/config.html
# By default uses the min_metric, meaning for each bias metric it uses as reference the group with minimum metric value (e.g. the group defined by race that has the lower FPR)
# Alternatively it can be 'majority' (picks the largest group to serve as reference) or 'predefined' (needs a list of key values, see below)

# PREDICTION
# How predictions are computed for train and test matrices
#
# Rank tiebreaking - In the predictions.rank_abs and rank_pct columns, ties in the score
# are broken either at random or based on the 'worst' or 'best' options. 'worst' is the default.
#
# 'worst' will break ties with the ascending label value, so if you
# take the top 'k' predictions, and there are ties across the 'k'
# threshold, the predictions above the threshold will be negative
# labels if possible. NULL labels are also pushed to the top.
# 'best' will break ties with the descending label value, so if you
# take the top 'k' predictions, and there are ties across the 'k'
# threshold, the predictions above the threshold will be positive
# labels if possible. NULL labels are pushed to the bottom.
# 'random' will choose one random ordering to break ties. The result will be affected by
# current state of Postgres' random number generator. Before ranking, the generator is seeded
# based on the *model*'s random seed.
#prediction:
#   rank_tiebreaker: "worst"


# MODEL SCORING
# How each trained model is scored
#
# Each entry in 'testing_metric_groups' needs a list of one of the metrics defined in
# catwalk.evaluation.ModelEvaluator.available_metrics (contributions welcome!)
# Depending on the metric, either thresholds or parameters
#
# Parameters specify any hyperparameters needed. For most metrics,
# which are simply wrappers of sklearn functions, these
# are passed directly to sklearn.
#
# Thresholds are more specific: The list is dichotomized and only the
# top percentile or top n entities are scored as positive labels
#
# subsets, if passed, will add evaluations for subset(s) of the predictions to
# the subset_evaluations tables, using the same testing and training metric
# groups as used for overall evaluations but with any thresholds reapplied only
# to entities in the subset on the relevant as_of_dates. For example, when
# calculating precision@5_pct for the subset of women, the ModelEvaluator will
# count as positively labeled the top 5% of women, rather than any women in the
# top 5% overall. This is useful if, for example, different interventions will
# be applied to different subsets of entities (e.g., one program will provide
# subsidies to the top 500 women with children and another program will provide
# shelter to the top 150 women without children) and you would like to see
# whether a single model can be used for both applications. Subsets can also be
# used to see how a model's performance would be affected if the requirements
# for intervention eligibility became more restricted.
#
# Subsets should be a list of dictionaries with the following keys:
#     - "name": a shorthand name for the subset
#     - "query": a query that returns distinct entity_ids belonging to the
#                subset on a given as_of_date with a placeholder for the
#                as_of_date being queried

#   `catwalk.individual_importance.CALCULATE_STRATEGIES` list
#   Will default to 'uniform', or just the global importances.
#
# n_ranks: The number of top features per individual to compute importances for

#
# Each lower-level key is a hyperparameter name for the given classifier, and
# each value is a list of potential values. All possible combinations of
# classifiers and hyperparameters are trained.
#
# NOTE: Triage now include a new parameter named 'model_grid_presets' (see above)
# you can't have both at the same time. The experiment will fail if you forget this.
