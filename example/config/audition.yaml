# CHOOSE MODEL GROUPS
# Audition needs a bunch of model_group_ids to help you select the models.
# The query is to choose what the model groups you want to include in the first round.
model_groups:
    query: |
        SELECT DISTINCT(model_group_id)
        FROM triage_metadata.model_groups

# CHOOSE TIMESTAMPS/TRAIN END TIMES
# The timestamps when audition happens for each model group.
# There's a hard rule in Audition that all of the chosen model groups for audition should
# have the same train end times as the timestamps or the subset of the timestamps from this
# query, otherwise those model groups with unmatched train end times will be pruned in the
# first round.
time_stamps:
    query: |
        SELECT DISTINCT train_end_time
        FROM triage_metadata.models
        WHERE model_group_id IN ({})
        AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM train_end_time) IN (1)
        AND train_end_time >= '2012-01-01'

# FILTER
# Configuration for the Auditioner
filter:
    metric: 'precision@' # metric of interest
    parameter: '50_abs' # parameter of interest
    max_from_best: 1.0 # The maximum value that the given metric can be worse than the best model for a given train end time. 
    threshold_value: 0.0 # The worst absolute value that the given metric should be. 
    distance_table: 'distance_table' # name of the distance table
    models_table: 'models' # name of the models table
    agg_type: 'worst' # Optional: how to aggregate multiple metric values if multiple models exist for a model group/train end time.

# RULES
# The selection rules for Audition to simulate the model selection process for each timestamps. 
# More rules can be found in the README.
# The metric and parameter in shared_parameters should be the same in the filter section as well.
