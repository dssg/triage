        "# Colab Triage Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a quick, interactive tutorial for [triage](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/triage/), a python machine learning pipeline for social good problems, using a sample of the data provided by [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) to the [2014 KDD Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data). Public schools in the United States face large disparities in funding, often resulting in teachers and staff members filling these gaps by purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets. DonorsChoose is an online crowdfunding platform that tries to help fill this gap by allowing teachers to seek funding for projects and resources from the community (projects can include classroom basics like books and markers, larger items like lab equipment or musical instruments, specific experiences like field trips or guest speakers). Projects on DonorsChoose expire after 4 months, and if the target funding level isn't reached, the project receives no funding. Since its launch in 2000, the platform has helped fund over 2 million projects at schools across the US, but about 1/3 of the projects that are posted nevertheless fail to meet their goal and go unfunded.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll imagine that DonorsChoose has hired a digital content expert who will review projects and help teachers improve their postings and increase their chances of reaching their funding threshold. Because this individualized review is a labor-intensive process, the digital content expert has time to review only 10% of the projects posted to the platform on a given day. \n",
        "\n",
        "### The Modeling Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "You are a data scientist working with DonorsChoose, and your task is to help this content expert focus their limited resources on projects that most need the help. As such, you want to build a model to identify projects that are least likely to be fully funded before they expire and pass them off to the digital content expert for review.\n",
        "\n",
        "In building that model, our unit of analysis (what triage calls a **cohort**) will be new projects right at the time they're posted, while the **label** we're seeing to predict is whether or not the project reaches its funding goal in the subsequent 4 months (before it expires), making our task a binary classification problem. In order to make this prediction, we'll develop **features** that include information we know about the project when it's posted as well as historical performance of other projects posted by this teacher, school, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Outline of the Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "The remainder of this tutorial will focus on how to use `triage` to solve this problem. Starting from scratch, we'll:\n",

        "- **Build models**, using `triage` to run the modeling pipeline.\n",
        "- **Look at the results** to ensure they make sense.\n",
        "- **Select the model to deploy** using the `audition` component of `triage`.\n",
        "- **Audit our models for bias** using `aequitas`.\n",

Although we were looking at the identifier `projectid_str` above, `triage` looks for a column called `entity_id` to uniquely identify entities to its models. We've already added this column to this dataset, so we'll use that below.\n",

        "\n",
        "As noted above, `triage` is designed for problems where the desire to generalize to future data and therefore is careful to respect the temporal nature of the problem. This is particularly salient in two places: defining the validation strategy for model evaluation and ensuring that features only make use of information available at the time of analysis/prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "For validation, the idea is generally simple: models should be trained on historical data and validated on future data. As such, `triage` constructs validation splits that reflect this process by using a certain point in time as the cut-off between training and validation and then moving this cut-off back through the data to generate multiple splits. The implementation is a bit more complicated and relies on several parameters, the details of which we won't go deep into here, but you can find a much deeper discussion in the [longer \"dirty duck\" tutorial](https://dssg.github.io/triage/dirtyduck/triage_intro/) as well as in the [experiment config docs](https://dssg.github.io/triage/experiments/experiment-config/).\n",

        "The temporal configuration described above will create several training and validation splits that can be used to estimate the generalization performance of your models and select a model specification to use going forward. In order to do so, of course, you need to choose an appropriate metric (or metrics) by which to evaluate your models. `triage` can use any of the metrics specified by `sklearn` and in general you'll want to focus on those that best reflect the goals, constraints, and deployment scenario of your project. For instance, in our example project, DonorsChoose can help only 10% of the projects posted to the site, so a metric like precision in the top 10% would reflect how efficiently these limited resources are being allocated to projects that would not be fully funded without additional support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we might want to focus on `precision@10%` as our primary metric, often it can be helpful to look at both precision and recall at a range of thresholds (both percentiles and absolute numbers) both for the purposes of debugging and understanding how sensitive your results are to the available resources, describing a \"menu\" of policy choices.\n",

        "\n",
        "Feature generation is typically the most important aspect of how well your machine learning models will work, so `triage` provides considerable flexibility for feature definition. However, this also means that this section of the configuration file can be particularly complicated and may require some experimentation to get familiar with. A few resources may be helpful for a deeper look at how features work in `triage`:\n",
        "- [Feature Definition in the Quickstart Guide](https://dssg.github.io/triage/triage_project_workflow/#define-some-additional-features)\n",
        "- [Feature Generation in the triage Documentation](https://dssg.github.io/triage/experiments/experiment-config/#feature-generation)\n",
        "- [Features in the Example Configuration File](https://github.com/dssg/triage/blob/master/example/config/experiment.yaml#L102)\n",
        "\n",
        "Features in `triage` are defined in blocks, grouping together features drawn from the same data source and allowing several related features to be constructed in a very compact format. Each of these blocks is a list item under the `feature_aggregations` section of your yaml configuration file and contains the following information:\n",
        "- A `prefix` that is used to identify the group of features.\n",
        "- A `from_obj` that specifies the underlying information used to construct the features in this group. This can be either a table or a query in itself (in the later case, be sure to give it an alias) and must contain both an `entity_id` column as well as a date column indicating when the information was known, identified to the feature config as the `knowledge_date_column`.\n",
        "- Information about how missing values should be imputed (see the documentation for details and available options here).\n",
        "- Definitions of the feature quantities/columns themselves, specified either as `aggregates` or `categoricals`, including the `metrics` for aggregations over time (e.g., `sum`, `max`, `avg`, etc).\n",
        "- Time ranges over which to calculate feature information, called `intervals` (e.g., last 6 months, last 5 years, etc.)\n",
        "- A level of aggregation for feature information (`groups`) -- this will almost always be just `entity_id`.\n",
        "\n",
        "🚧 &nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: All features in `triage` are temporal aggregates. Just as `triage` is designed to carefully account for time in temporal cross-validation, it also does so in feature construction focusing on what information was known at training or validation time. Even features you might generally consider \"static\" need to be associated with a knowledge date for these purposes as well as an aggregation metric. This is also true for categoricals, which are first one-hot encoded from each instance then aggregated over the given time interval with the specified metric. For instance, if a patient has had several hospital stays with different primary diagnosis codes at each stay, a categorical feature using a `sum` aggregation would yield a count of how many stays had a given diagnosis while a `max` aggregation would provide an indicator of whether a given diagnosis was ever present. \n",

        "`{prefix}_entity_id_{interval}_{quantity}_{value}_{metric}`\n",
        "\n",
        "🚧 &nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING: Because `triage`'s features are stored in a `postgres` database, this naming convention can sometimes run afoul of the database's 63 character limit for column names, leading to truncation. When this happens, you might encounter errors indicating a given feature column appears to be missing. This can be common with categoricals with particularly long values, so recoding can be useful in those cases (as can choosing shorter prefix names).\n",

Because there's generally no way to know a priori what model specification will work best for a given problem, `triage` makes it easy to run and explore an extensive grid by providing lists of values for each hyperparameter and training models for the full cross-product of these values.\n",

        "- `BaselineRankMultiFeature` is a simple baseline method that ranks examples by one or more features, replicating a comonsense approach that could be taken without making use of machine learning. This method takes a single hyperparameter, `rules`, specified as a list of dictionaries with the keys `feature` and `low_value_high_score` to specify the directin of the ranking. Examples are sorted first by the first feature in this list, then the next, and so on.\n",
        "- `SimpleThresholder` is another basic baseline method, allowing you to specify a heuristic, rule-based approach to classifying examples. It uses two hyperparameters: a list of `rules` (e.g., `feature_1 > 3`) and a `logical_operator` (e.g., `and` or `or`) to specify how the rules are combined.\n",

Like the evaluation metrics described above, you'll also need to specify the set of thresholds against which you want to calculate fairness metrics.
